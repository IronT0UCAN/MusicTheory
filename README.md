This is a simple program that displays relative notes, chords, scales, and modes of a given note. It also displays complementary frequencies if A4 = x for easy tuning or note-value precision.
The chord database is certainly not exhaustive, but it has been based on a one-hand piano-approach (i.e. a polyphony of <=5). This will be added onto in the future if the program generates enough attention or desire.
